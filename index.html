      <h3>Programming</h3>
      <p>Im currently teaching myself Python, HTML, CSS, Django, and SQL.
        I've learned a little Javascript as well and plan to learn more as well as C# and cybersecurity.
        I'm learning a little bit more every day, and theres so much to learn!
        I was always interested in coding but thought I had to wait and get into a school for coding.
        Eventually I just decided to learn how to code on my own using resources on the internet</p>

      <h3>Reading</h3>
      <p>I love to read and have great reading and writing skills
          I bought a kindle and its great for reading.</p>
            <p>It sits nicely in the palm of your hand and makes reading
            much more comfortable</p>
            <p>I also play videogames, camp, and fish</p>
